NEWS - list of user-visible changes between releases of GNU libtool.

New in 0.9e:
* Bug fixes.
* Automake support for Libtool now uses the LTLIBRARIES primary.  See
  the Automake documentation for more information.
* Added new `--disable-static' flag to disable building static
  libraries on platforms that have shared libs.
* Basic support for dynamically loaded modules: new `-export-dynamic'
  linking flag and corresponding `dlname' mode.
* New `--features' flag to display configured libtool attributes.
* Support *-*-linux-gnu* as an alias for *-*-linux*.
* Support for *-*-openbsd*.

New in 0.9:
* Bug fixes.
* The libtool demo now uses the libm cos(3) function, to demonstrate
  inter-library dependencies.
* The PLATFORMS file has been moved to doc/platforms.texi.

New in 0.8:
* Bug fixes, and more documentation.
* Basic support for other language compilers (C++, Fortran, and
  preprocessed assembler).
* Libtool is now more persistent when linking with the `-static'
  flag fails.
* New test for hardcoding system linkers, to verify that libtool
  neither creates incorrect binaries, nor takes unnecessary
  precautions while linking against uninstalled shared libraries.
* For clarity, the demo subdirectory no longer uses ansi2knr, and has
  been rewritten to avoid ANSI-only constructs.
* Support for *-*-irix5, *-*-irix6*, and *-*-sco3.2v5*.

New in 0.7:
* Total rewrite of libtool, along with a new model for library building.
* Completely rewritten documentation for the new paradigm.
* Sane handling of broken system linkers, such as the ones on AIX
  and HP-UX.
* configure mode is now a separate program, `ltconfig'
* The libinfo helper script has been incorporated into the main
  libtool program.
* Automatic mode guessing, based on the command line.
* Full support for Automake 1.2 (including ansi2knr features).
* Support to create reloadable objects using link mode.
* Support for new `-static' linking flag.
* Support for stripping libraries during installation.
* Library version information is now passed on the command line, not
  through a version file.

Version 0.6 was never released.

New in 0.5:
* Disabled install-progs until next version, when it will be correctly
  implemented.
* Clearer library versioning documentation.  See (libtool)Versioning.
* Renamed gm_PROG_LIBTOOL to AM_PROG_LIBTOOL
* Libtool now creates pseudo-objects named foo.lo and pseudo-archives named
  libfoo.la instead of foo.o and libfoo.a.  See the documentation.
* libtool compile doesn't interfere with user CFLAGS if they don't
  conflict with the current objtype.  From Karl Berry.
* Created new libinfo helper script.
* libversion.in files are obsolete -- libtool uses libinfo to read the
  new LIBINFO files.
* Libtool is better at finding its config file and helper scripts.
* Support for *-*-gnu*

New in 0.4:
* Bug fixes and new regression tests
* On unsupported configurations, ``libtool configure'' demotes OBJTYPES to
  `standard' instead of aborting
* Added new object type, `t', for tcov(1) support
* Support for *-*-aix3*, *-*-aix4*, *-*-hpux10*, *-*-osf3*, and *-*-solaris2*

New in 0.3:
* Bug fixes and new regression tests
* Added new uninstall-libs mode
* Added a host argument to configure mode
* Fixed debugging/hyper-optimizing flags conflict (from Karl Berry)
* Support for --no-whole-archive when needed by GNU ld (from Ulrich Drepper)
* Implementation of --enable-linktype, --enable-profile, --enable-shared,
  --enable-static in gm_PROG_LIBTOOL macro
* New `libtoolize' program (modeled after GNU gettext's `gettextize') to help
  conversion to libtool
* New ABOUT-LIBS document for inclusion with libtool-supported packages

New in 0.2:
* Support for *-*-linux
* Better checking for GNU ld
* Reimplemented the config file so that it corresponds more closely to the
  variables listed in (libtool)Porting Libtool.
* Reimplemented the shared library version scheme.  See (libtool)Versioning.
* Replaced `--config-file' and `--version-file' options with `--confdir'
* Added new install-libs and install-progs modes

New in 0.1:
* First release of libtool
* Support for: *-*-freebsd*, *-*-netbsd*, *-*-sunos4*, *-*-ultrix4*
