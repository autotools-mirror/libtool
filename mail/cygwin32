   It would seem that the dll code has bitrotted =(O|  Pity.  Ian, do you
   have time/want to fix this, or do you want to pass the torch on?

I no longer have access to a Windows machine, nor do I have all that
much interest in the problem, so I'd say that somebody else had better
pick up the torch.

Incidentally, I believe that DJ Delorie is working on adding DLL
support directly to ld, which will mean that dlltool is no longer
required, and should make it possible to greatly simplify the win32
hacks in dlltool, perhaps even simply using the standard GNU ld code.

   Shouldn't libtool notice that it is running on cygwin32 and pass the
   -no-undefined option by itself?  It seems to go against the raison
   d'etre for libtool to force the Makefile developer to figure this out...

This kind of goes to the heart of libtool.  libtool wants to present a
particular interface for using shared libraries.  In order to do this,
it assumes that the system supports certain capabilities.  One of
those is that the system can support undefined symbols in shared
libraries.

That means that on systems which do not permit shared libraries to
have undefined symbols--AIX and Windows--libtool doesn't really work.

The --no-undefined option is a hack which tells libtool that the
shared library has special characteristics which permit libtool to
create a shared library on AIX or Windows, or any other supported
platform.

I think the general idea is that you should use the --no-undefined
option whenever possible.  If you do, you will be able to create
shared libraries on AIX and Windows.  If you do not or can not, you
will not be able to create them.

libtool should not add a --no-undefined option itself.  If it used
that option inappropriately, then building the shared library would
fail.  Instead, libtool users should always use --no-undefined if they
can.

Of course, there are problems.  For example, in the GNU binutils, I
can arrange matters such that --no-undefined will work on Windows, but
to do so I have to link various libraries together and I have to link
against special Windows system libraries.  So I do that, which means
that I have to change the options I pass to libtool based on the
system.

In other words, the interface which libtool presents is deficient.  It
does not successfully hide the system on which it is running, and it
forces the code which calls libtool to make adjustments.

I doubt there is any wholly acceptable solution here.  The only
workable one I can see would be to effectively enhance Windows and AIX
shared libraries such that they support creating shared libraries with
undefined symbols.  On Windows, this could be done by doing the link
once, checking for undefined symbols, creating little stub routines
for those symbols which track down the symbols in some other open DLL,
compiling those stubs, and linking them into the DLL.  Perhaps
something similar is possible on AIX.

Of course even that will not make Windows DLLs identical to ELF shared
libraries.  ELF shared libraries permit the main program to override a
symbol in the shared library, and Windows DLLs do not.

Ian

When libtool links DLLs, it strips some command line switches. It's probably
the case that this is ok for most situations. However, this potentially breaks
Mingw32 support in the Cygwin environment.

In order to get Mingw32 support in Cygwin, the compiler must be invoked with
the -mno-cygwin switch. If libtool strips this switch out during the link
process, the resulting binary will get linked with the wrong import libraries.

The following is a small example. I've edited the output a bit for
readability. When I send this email, long lines will get broken up, so it
still might be a bit difficult to read.

They landed in binutils-20000625, and were finetuned/tweaked to a fairly
stable point by binutils-20000722 (the current version in /latest).

Also, there were a few additions that changed ld's default search order
for libraries:
  -Bstatic -lfoo  : 
    looks for libfoo.a
  -Bdynamic -lfoo : 
    looks for libfoo.dll.a (default name for an import lib)
         then foo.dll.a    (alt. name for an import lib)
         then libfoo.dll   (link directly to a dll)
         then foo.dll      (ditto, alt. name)
     finally, libfoo.a     (fall back to static lib)

The spec file for gcc (as of 2.95.2-2) changed so that:
   gcc -static   calls 'ld -Bstatic'
   gcc           calls 'ld -Bdynamic'

Finally, 'gcc -shared' will build a dll, but you need to pass linker
options like '-Wl,--out-implib=libfoo.dll.a' explicitly. 

FWIW, all of the (non-libtool) libraries I've dll-ized do not use
dlltool at all, and rely only on gcc (and ld, indirectly).

AFAIK, Unix systems that support dlopen() don't prefix C symbol
names with `_' when compiling them to assembler in the first place,
so the issue is moot.  At least this is the case on Solaris (2.7),
Linux (>= libc6), and OSF1 (3.2 ), which are the systems that
I have easily available right now.  dlopen() originated on Solaris,
according to the Linux man page.

On systems such as Cygwin which do prefix C names with `_' when
compiling to assembler, whether dlopen() should prefix the name with an
underscore depends on whether the name that the user is trying to look
up is an assembly name or a C name.  If it's a C name, then it's right
for dlopen() to prefix the name with an underscore, to match what the
C compiler does, but if it's an assembly name, then doing that would
be wrong.  Unfortunately the interface to dlopen() provides the
dlopen() implementation with no clues as to which one the user meant.
The documentation for dlopen() says that the argument is the "symbol
name", which is ambiguous, but could be read as implying that it is
supposed to be the assembly name.  However, in practice most uses of
dlopen() tend to be passing C names rather than assembler names.

Probably most uses of dlopen() are for C names, and so inserting
the prefix would work well in most cases.  However, inserting the
prefix would also make it impossible to look up assember names that
don't start with underscore using dlopen().

It's a bit like the issue of text-versus-binary:
the original unix-only interface didn't need to distinguish
between the different cases (text/binary or C/asm/whatever),
but in the Windows environment, you do need to make such
distinctions.  So some programs will need source modifications.
The best you can do is to choose the default carefully,
and make it easy to override the default for programs for which
the default is not appropriate.

Holy cr@p! What happened to simplicity?  If Bill has decided that he
can't understand how to write a decent shared library system, and
want's to relegate dll's to LoadLibrary() objects, why doesn't he just
say so?  Wouldn't it be easier to statically link a Win2k program that
twiddle about with all this .local mess?

This sounds promising.  I'll see if I can find any details on it.

Based on our conversation so far:

  * When building a libtool (.la) library, create libfoo.la,
    libfoo<iface>.dll, libfoo.dll.a and libfoo.a, where:
      - <iface> is the earliest fully supported interface number
      - libfoo.dll.a is the import library for libfoo<iface>.dll
      
  * When installing a libtool (.la) library:
      - libfoo.la goes to $prefix/lib
      - libfoo<iface>.dll goes to $prefix/bin
      - libfoo.dll.a goes to $prefix/lib
      - libfoo.a goes to $prefix/lib
      
  * When linking against libfoo.la
      - use libfoo.dll.a unless -static or -all-static 
      - otherwise use libfoo.a

  * When linking against -lfoo
      - if libfoo.la is found, behave as above
      - else let ld (or gcc) do its thing

Which is especially cool, because I don't think I need to worry about
dealing with direct linkage to dlls (I can just punt and let gcc/ld do
the hard work) which removes a whole pile of spaghetti where I had to
cope with compiling the impgen code correctly in cross compilation
environments!

I didn't know about that.  Thanks.

Or that.  Thanks again!  Libtool already provides --disable-static if
the user wants to build and install only the dll parts of the library.

For this to work (that is, in order for me to be able to punt to gcc/ld
in the majority of cases) I must generate dll names that will be
found, so the cygfoo.dll idea is out (Sorry Paul!).

Although this doesn't help ``User 2'' very much, he is no worse off
than before if I change libtool's behaviour in this way.  Here's a
thought:  For each dll using application linked, I could have libtool
install a .bat script to C:/cygwin/launch (or similar) which would set
the PATH environment correctly for that application.  As long as
``User 2'' has the launch directory higher in his PATH than the actual
binary directory, this would guarantee correct dll selection.

This would give ``User 1'' many of the advantages shared libraries
offer on Unix, without sinking into DLL Hell.  Assuming that everyone
buys into it.  The only reason shared libraries work properly on Unix
is that everyone has to agree to conform to the runtime loader's
versioning scheme -- so don't give some excuse about ``if we don't
want to change the core cygwin dll's to conform this won't work''.  On
my linux box, I can move my libc around or drop several incompatible
versions of libc into my filesystem, and my applications will stop
loading the intended libraries too.  No surprises there!

Cheers,
	Gary.

Hmm.  I hadn't thought of that.  Still, at least the principle of the
thing is right now, I think...

There's an easier way -- one command!  'gcc -shared' will create a dll
for you.  Just do:

$(BASE)=foo

  gcc -shared -o cyg$(BASE).dll -Wl,--out-implib=lib$(BASE).dll.a \
    -Wl,--export-all -Wl,--enable-auto-image-base \
    -Wl,--output-def=cyg$(BASE).def $(OBJS)

Grab any of the packages in the 'contrib' directory and look an the
makefiles (you might need to do a minimal 'configure' first, to
customize the Makefile for cygwin before using it as a model)

You still need to worry about things like __declspec(dllexport) and
__declspec(dllimport).  Here's a patch for your files.  

(Yes, you are correct; the option is '--export-all-symbols' not
'--export-all')

As far as documentation, there's the mailing list, and 'ld --help' and
Mumit's (really out-of-date) dll-helpers packaqe at
http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32/dllhelpers.html. 
Would you like to update that package for the current capabilities of
ld/gcc ?  Mumit's tutorial is heavily 'dlltool' based, rather than 'gcc
-shared' or 'ld' based.

NOTE 1: I had to remove "-Wl,--export-all-symbols" from the options;
with export-all I got a stack dump even with my other changes. I'm not
sure why.

NOTE 2: I used the extension '.dll.a' for the import library; cygwin's
linker will search for 'libfoo.dll.a' in preference to 'libfoo.a';
libfoo.a is assumed to be a static library (although the linker will use
libfoo.a if .dll.a is not found)

If you really want to --export-all in C++, this is a workaround.
Create a def with dlltool:
 dlltool --export-all --output-def foo_.def --dllname foo.dll *.o

Then look at the def file.  Do you still really want to export-all?

To use that def file with ld -shared you need to get rid of the
comments (demangled names) 
cut does the job:
  cut -d ';' -f 1 foo_.def >foo.def
