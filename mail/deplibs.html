<h1>Inter-library Dependencies</h1>

<p>About twice a week, for the last five weeks, I've been receiving
bug reports which tell me that libtool's inter-library dependency
handling is broken.

<p>I know.  I broke it intentionally, until I have the time to fix it
myself, or somebody else takes the time to help me with it.

<p>These same people often give me a simple one-line patch which
re-enables my old, simplistic inter-library dependencies, but nobody
seems to want to test things thoroughly and come up with a real
solution.

<p>If you don't care about the history, and you just want to help me
out, jump to <a href="#solution">the bottom of this document</a>.

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Libtool's basic premise is to make static and shared libraries
behave the same way from a programmer's point of view.  This allows
users to build a libtoolized package with or without shared libraries,
determined at configuration time.  It does this by using a
<dfn>libtool object</dfn> (<samp>.lo</samp>) and <dfn>libtool
archive</dfn> (<samp>.la</samp>) abstraction, so that the package
maintainer can use libtool to operate on these files without making
any assumptions about their underlying representation.

<p>For the most part, this abstraction works well, and has made
libtool as popular as it is today.  Without this abstraction, it would
be significantly harder to port libtool to new platforms.

<p>Unfortunately, what this abstraction has also done is reveal some
fundamental inconsistencies with most shared library implementations.
Every shared library implementation works well for `hello world'-type
examples, but very few are robust and well-designed so that libtool
doesn't need special tricks in order to build correct, featureful
shared libraries.

<p>Providing inter-library dependencies is one feature that has
revealed these kinds of inconsistencies.

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>My orginal inter-library dependency code received rigourous testing
in beta releases of <a href="http://www.red-bean.com/guile/">GNU
Guile</a>.  As soon as the Guile people started using my code, I
received a flood of bug reports.  People were reporting that
<samp>libguile</samp> (Guile's main shared library) was failing to
link, or that programs linked against <samp>libguile</samp> were
dumping core.

<p>Not good.

<p>The Guile people chased this bug down to the following scenario:

<ol>
<li>The user's system has a static regexp library installed,
<samp>librx.a</samp>.

<li>Guile's <samp>configure</samp> script detects that the
<samp>-lrx</samp> linker option can be used to link in
<samp>librx</samp>.

<li>When <samp>libguile</samp> is built, the <samp>-lrx</samp> linker
option is used.

<li>Some linkers fail at this point, because they don't allow shared
libraries to contain or depend on static libraries.

<li>If the linker didn't fail, then a few programs are linked against
<samp>libguile</samp>.

<li>On some systems, these programs core dump because
<samp>libguile</samp> is a shared library that contains non-PIC code
(from <samp>librx</samp>).
</ol>

<h2>The interim solution</h2>

<p>I needed some way to respond to these reports.  I saw my options (in
order of my preference) as:

<ol>
<li>Write code in <samp>ltmain.sh</samp> to prevent static libraries
from appearing in inter-library dependencies.  This would take some
work, but obviously is the best solution.

<li>Find the systems that fail, and turn off inter-library
dependencies on only those systems.

<li>Force the package maintainer to guarantee that static libraries
never appear in inter-library dependencies.
</ol>

<p>I immediately vetoed the last solution, because that would violate
the whole point of using libtool, and would cause a lot of people to
waste time solving a problem that really should be fixed by libtool.

<p>I preferred the first solution, but at the time of the reports, I
didn't see an obviously simple mechanism for detecting the difference
between shared and static libraries.

<p>So, in the meantime, I tried turning off inter-library dependencies
on the systems that failed.

<p>I quickly discovered, to my chagrin, that many systems fail.  So,
it was be simpler for me to turn off <em>all</em> inter-library
dependencies, then find out which systems work, rather than vice
versa.

<h2>The current situation</h2>

<p>I've been busy trying to avoid bankruptcy.  It's been over three
months since I first turned off inter-library dependencies, and I
still haven't completed the solution I want.

<p>I've been gearing up for the 1.1 release of libtool, because there
is a high demand for a stable public release.  So, I'm not going to
introduce any destabilizing changes to the inter-library dependency
code until after 1.1 is released.

<h2><a name="solution">The solution</a></h2>

<p>So, I want to tell you how you can help me solve the various
dilemmas surrounding this issue:

<ol>
<li>I need to find out more about the nature of the problems I ran
into with Guile.  Unfortunately, I cannot reproduce them in simple
tests on my own platform (i586-pc-linux-gnulibc1), even though I think
they were reported here.  I need to find out which platforms already
have perfect inter-library dependency support, how to work around the
problem on other platforms, and, more importantly, exactly
<em>why</em> some systems give me problems and others don't.

<p>On correct platforms, you can link <em>any</em> static library
against a shared library via the <samp>-lNAME</samp> option without
the linker complaining, then link a program against this library and
run it without dumping core.  I know that this scenario will always
work fine on the following systems:

 <ul>
 <li>None reported yet.
 </ul>

<p>I also know that on some systems, you can create a shared library
linked against a static one, but running programs linked against such
a library will dump core:

 <ul>
 <li>None reported yet.
 </ul>

<p>Finally, there are some systems which won't even allow you to link
a shared library against a static one:

 <ul>
 <li>Solaris 2.x
 </ul>

<li>Help me figure out a good, portable way to detect if a given
<samp>-lNAME</samp> option refers to a shared library or not, since
that is needed as a workaround to the problem.  Some suggestions so
far have been:

 <ul>
 <li>Link the library against a tiny test program, and:

  <ul>
  <li>run <samp>ldd(1)</samp> on the test program and search for
  <samp>libNAME</samp> in the ldd output.
  <li>use the <samp>-verbose</samp> flag for GNU ld in order to see
  which library is actually linked.
  <li>run some sort of other program to determine if the library was
  dynamic.
  </ul>

 <li>Track the <samp>-LDIR</samp> flags, do a search for the library,
 and then check whether it is shared by:

  <ul>
  <li>using the <samp>file(1)</samp> program.
  <li>looking at its suffix.
  </ul>
 </ul>

<li>Contact any people you know who might be interested, get them to
read this page, so that they can help me solve the problem.

<li>Send me money, so that I can devote more of my time to solving the
problem.
</ol>

<p>Thank you for your help, and have fun.
