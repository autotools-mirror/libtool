There are several references to a future release of Automake in
libtool, that may not work with your own copy of Automake.  Only
releases of Automake after automake-1.1j work with libtool.

You can find the latest Automake prerelease (warning: it may have
bugs) at:

<URL:ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/tromey/>

Once Automake 1.2 is released, you should get it from your closest GNU
mirror.

** If you have automake-1.1k, you'll need to apply the following patch
before installing it:
